The Perverse Erse

The evening crowd had thinned at Moriarty's in South Bend, and only
the regulars were left, a small group at one end of the dark oak bar,
chatting quietly. At that moment a short gaunt man entered, and in a
very thick brogue ordered a glass of Tullamore Dew. Finishing his drink
he sighed deeply and put a thick manila envelope on the bar. He sighed
again and at this Phineas O'Rourke put down his beer and remarked,
"Sure now, that's the most mournful sound I've heard since the day me
grandfather fell down the stairs with a case of the real Irish in his
arms; twelve bottles broken, it were."

The stranger turned toward Phineas, and his face had the haunted look
of a man who has looked upon some incredible catastrophe testing the
very limits of man's sanity and barely survived. Again he sighed,
then lifted the envelope with his left hand and waved it vaguely in
Phineas' direction. His voice broke as he spoke. "I had to, I really
had to. After all, as head of the department of research anthropology
at the university, I'm duty-bound to report this. But they wouldn't
accept it; in fact, they--politely, of course--suggested I take a
sabbatical until I got over it. I understand their position, and
perhaps releasing this information would have a terrible effect on
Erin, but in the name of truth and science, it should be known."

At the mention of possible harm to the Emerald Isle, the whole group
perked up their ears, and John Gaffney politely asked, "Is it something
you could be telling us about? Sure and it's interested we'd be if it
has to do with Ireland." The rest of them nodded and added a chorus of
ayes.

The sad-looking man sighed again, looked at his empty glass and,
nodding to the bartender, to refill it, began opening the manila
envelope.

"I suppose I ought to introduce myself first. I'm Paul Corscadden,
assistant professor of anthropology. Though born in the old country,
I was raised here in the midwest--caught between two cultures, as it
were."

At this point, the bartender, caught up in the unfolding of this tragic
story, commented, "But your brogue...."

"Yes, of course," interrupted the professor, "it returned during my
field trip to county Mayo three months ago. But that's getting ahead
of the story. Here...." Reaching into the envelope, he took out a
manuscript, "let me just read the article to you."

The bartender refilled all glasses as the group settled back, lighting
pipes, to listen in intense curiosity tinged with dread somehow
conveyed by the utter misery in Professor Corscadden's voice.

       *       *       *       *       *

AN EXPLANATION FOR THE LUPRACAN PHENOMENON AS DISCOVERED IN AN
INVESTIGATION OF THE CULTURE OF EIRE.

"Long considered to be wholly mythical, the little Irish elf, commonly
known as the Leprechaun, has an enormous amount of folklore associated
with it. Such tales as...." Here the professor interrupted and said,
"This is unnecessary; I'm sure you all know the background to this
field study; let me get to the crux of the matter." And turning to the
last pages in the manuscript, he began again.

"Perhaps the most universally known legend associated with Lupracan
is that associated with the pot of gold each of the elves is supposed
to possess. It has been rather universally observed among the natives
of this island, that if one captures one of these sprites, it will
beg desperately to be released. If the captor does not do so, it
will next resort to all sorts of trickery and magic. Failing this,
the tightfisted individual who maintains his grasp on the little
man will then be offered a pot of gold, ostensibly the life savings
of this immortal creature. It is invariably at this point that,
conditions being what they are in Ireland, the fortunate individual
who has contrived to trap a lugharcan ('anthropologists always delight
in technical terms' interpolated professor Corscadden, using the
interruption to sip from his refilled glass and seeming to relax a
bit as the power of the golden brew began to take effect) agrees to
the bargain. There are no known records of what might happen or what
the next efforts of the leprechaun might be were his captor to still
refuse. Indeed there is something a bit ominous in the absence of such
information. This background material should be borne in mind as I
describe an experience I had while doing research in a hamlet deep in
the heart of the area under investigation.

"On leaving the pub--a logical place for interviewing the local
townsfolk--I took what I thought to be a short-cut to my quarters,
through a small wooded area. It was pleasantly shaded and dim.
Suddenly, in the shadows there was a movement and just as it caught
my eye, whatever had moved froze into immobility. As I walked towards
it to investigate, the creature flushed and ran. With some difficulty
I pursued it, suddenly realizing it was a little old man! It was
with the greatest of difficulty that I was able to maintain my cool,
scientific detachment as I realized that I was close to the possibility
of realizing the researcher's dream, the objectivication of certain
data previously thought to be spurious. Just at the edge of the wood,
the figure stumbled and I was able to get a firm grasp on its arm. It
spoke in a pathetic voice, pleading to be released (first in Gaelic,
then, recognizing my weakness in that tongue, in English), and it
would have had to be a cruel man indeed (or one who knew of the pot
of gold) to have resisted such a piteous request. Notwithstanding, I
firmly drew him toward the meadow, intent on getting a clear picture
of this amazing discovery. The creature's pleadings grew most intense
at this point, and for a moment, he seemed to change into some sort
of snake-like creature (an obvious impossibility in Ireland), but
before it was able to do anything else, I had brought it out into broad
sunlight. The explanation for his terrible need to be released into
the shadows and not be publicly viewed became horrendously clear. So
shocking was my realization of this phenomenon that my hands became
paralyzed, and I could not hold my captive. With a cry of gratified
relief, it fled to the shadows of the woods while I sank to the grass
in stupefaction.

"It has been only after full consideration of the tremendous impact
that release of this information will have on the peoples of this
fascinating culture, of the devastating effect it will have on their
sympathizers in this country and others where their descendants
have gone, that I decided that in the interests of science and true
knowledge the facts _must_ be known. It is therefore with terribly
mixed emotions and deepest sympathy for those who must be hurt that I
make this information public: The leprechaun, for such it must have
been, was, from head to toe, including his hair, a brilliant shade of
orange!"

A pall of silence hung over the room when Professor Corscadden had
finished speaking. With bowed head, the tragic figure slowly replaced
the document into the folder, then wiped at the tears on his cheek. The
group, themselves moist-eyed, looked sympathetically at the professor,
then quickly averted their eyes to avoid staring at the unsightly
blotch on his right hand, an orange blotch with an uncanny resemblance
to a shamrock.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™'s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation's website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
